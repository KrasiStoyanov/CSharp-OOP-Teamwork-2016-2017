1. Concept
	- you are a knigth
	- you have to pass some tests (~10-15 steps)
	- on each step you come accross 3 doors, which hide different types of secrets (potions, items, weapons, opponents)
	- there is a shop with you, from which you can buy all these items and weapons for money you have gathered or you can sell items/weapons/etc. in exchange for money
	- there is a last step where there are no doors, there is only one dragon, which you have to figth with your gathered items, weaons, potions, army and health

2. Mods
	- Singleplayer
